Week 11: More on OOP

Dive deeper into advanced OOP concepts (e.g., abstract classes and interfaces).
Learn about decorators and how they work in Python.
Week 12: Review and Practice

Work on mini-projects that apply OOP concepts.
Practice exercises to reinforce OOP principles.
Month 4: Data Structures and Algorithms
Goal: Understand fundamental algorithms and data structures for problem-solving.

Week 13: Algorithms Basics

Learn basic sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort.
Understand searching algorithms: Linear search and Binary search.
Week 14: More on Data Structures

Learn about stacks, queues, and linked lists.
Understand sets, heaps, and trees.
Week 15: Big-O Notation

Understand the concept of time and space complexity.
Learn how to analyze algorithms using Big-O notation.
Week 16: Practice Algorithms

Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars.
Implement and optimize common algorithms.
Month 5: Web Development Basics
Goal: Get hands-on with web development using Python.

Week 17: Introduction to Web Development

Learn about HTTP, client-server architecture, and web frameworks.
Understand how to set up a basic Flask web application.
Week 18: Flask Framework

Learn about routing, templates, and request handling.
Understand how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development.
Create basic forms and handle user input.
Week 19: Databases and Python

Learn how to connect to a database (SQLite or PostgreSQL) from Python.
Understand SQL basics (CRUD operations).
Integrate a database with a Flask application.
Week 20: Project – Build a Simple Web App

Build a simple CRUD web application (e.g., a to-do list or blog app).
Practice deploying it using platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.
Month 6: Final Projects and Advanced Topics
Goal: Apply what you've learned and explore more advanced topics.

Week 21: Advanced Python Topics

Learn about generators and iterators.
Understand Python’s memory management and how to use gc (garbage collection).
Dive into advanced libraries like asyncio for asynchronous programming.
Week 22: Data Science Introduction (Optional)

Get familiar with Python libraries for data analysis: Pandas, NumPy.
Learn basic data visualization with Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Week 23: Final Project – Full Application

Start a larger final project: it could be a more complex web app, a data analysis project, or even a machine learning project.
Use Git for version control and deploy your project online.
Week 24: Review and Polish

Review everything you've learned.
Refactor and improve your final project.
Start learning how to contribute to open-source projects or share your work on GitHub.
Additional Tips:
Consistency: Practice coding daily or weekly. Even 1 hour a day can make a difference.
Project-Based Learning: Build small projects as you learn to apply concepts.
Problem Solving: Practice problems regularly on coding platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codewars.
Read Documentation: The official Python documentation is an excellent resource to deepen your understanding.
Resources:
Books: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart (great for beginners).
Courses: Python for Everybody (Coursera), Real Python (realpython.com), or freeCodeCamp’s Python tutorials on YouTube.
Practice: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codewars, or Project Euler for solving coding challenges.
By following this plan, you'll not only learn Python but also build a solid understanding of its real-world applications. Happy coding!
